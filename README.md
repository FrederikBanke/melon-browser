# Browser styles

This repository contains the styles I use in my browser's `chrome` folder.

I use the [Zen Browser](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/) and the primary styles come from [Natsumi](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/natsumi-browser).

Natsumi current has no styles for tab groups, but I have added a fix for that, so that tab groups have styles.
